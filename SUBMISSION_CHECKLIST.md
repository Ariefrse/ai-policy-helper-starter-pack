## Quick Verification Commands

Run these just before submission:

```bash
# 1. Check git status (should be clean)
git status

# 2. Verify .env is not tracked
git ls-files | grep -E '\.env$'
# Should return nothing

# 3. Check all services running
docker compose ps
# All should show "Up"

# 4. Test ingestion
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ingest
# Should return indexed_docs and indexed_chunks

# 5. Test acceptance query 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Can a customer return a damaged blender after 20 days?"}' \
  | jq '.citations[].title'
# Should include Returns_and_Refunds.md and Warranty_Policy.md

# 6. Test acceptance query 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"What'\''s the shipping SLA to East Malaysia for bulky items?"}' \
  | jq '.citations[].title'
# Should include Delivery_and_Shipping.md

# 7. Run all tests

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use
**Fix:** Set `FRONTEND_PORT=3001` in `.env` (already done)

### Issue: Qdrant not connecting
**Fix:**
```bash
docker compose restart qdrant
docker compose logs qdrant
```

### Issue: Tests failing
**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-ingest data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ingest

# Run tests again
docker compose run --rm backend pytest -v
```

### Issue: Citations not showing
**Fix:** Check browser console for CORS errors. Verify CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`

### Issue: Video too large
**Fix:** Compress with ffmpeg:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -crf 28 output.mp4
```
