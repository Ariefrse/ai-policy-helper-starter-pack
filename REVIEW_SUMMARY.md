## 🔍 Areas of Excellence

### Code Organization
```
backend/app/
├── main.py          # Clean API routes only (105 lines)
├── rag.py           # RAG engine with proper abstraction (424 lines)
├── ingest.py        # Document loading and chunking (80 lines)
├── models.py        # Pydantic validation (83 lines)
└── settings.py      # Configuration management
```

### Separation of Concerns
- **API Layer:** FastAPI routes with middleware
- **Business Logic:** RAG engine with retrieval and generation
- **Data Layer:** Vector store abstraction (Qdrant/in-memory)
- **Validation:** Pydantic models with custom validators

### Error Handling
```python
# Example from backend/app/rag.py:387-399
try:
    answer = self.llm.generate(query, contexts)
    logger.info(f"Generated answer for query: {query[:50]}...")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"LLM generation failed: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    logger.info("Falling back to stub LLM")
    fallback = StubLLM()
    answer = fallback.generate(query, contexts)
```

## Questions to Expect

### Technical Questions
**Q: Why did you use deterministic local embeddings instead of OpenAI embeddings?**
A: For offline-first operation and cost efficiency. Local embeddings are fast (~18ms), deterministic for testing, and work without API keys. Production could use OpenAI for better semantic quality.

**Q: How does your caching strategy prevent memory leaks?**
A: Implemented custom LRU cache with bounded size (1000 retrieval, 500 generation). Thread-safe with locks. Old entries automatically evicted when limit reached.

**Q: Why MMR reranking instead of simple cosine similarity?**
A: MMR balances relevance and diversity to avoid redundant chunks from the same document. Lambda=0.6 prioritizes relevance while ensuring varied sources.

**Q: How do you handle concurrent ingestion requests?**
A: Thread-safe with `_ingest_lock` to prevent race conditions during chunk insertion. Atomic operations for counter updates.

### Design Questions
**Q: What trade-offs did you make?**
A: Input validation adds ~1-2ms latency but prevents injection attacks. Cache size limits reduce hit rate but prevent memory leaks. Environment-based CORS adds config but improves security.

**Q: What would you change for production?**
A: Add authentication, rate limiting, distributed tracing, Prometheus metrics, streaming responses, and hybrid search (semantic + keyword).

**Q: Why FastAPI instead of Flask?**
A: Modern Python features (type hints, async), automatic API docs with Swagger, built-in validation with Pydantic, better performance for concurrent requests.
